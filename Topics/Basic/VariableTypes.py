# Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. It means that when you create a variable, you reserve some space in the memory.
# Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.
# Therefore, by assigning different data types to the variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.
