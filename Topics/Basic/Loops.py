# In general, statements are executed sequentially âˆ’ The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
# There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.
#
# Programming languages provide various control structures that allow more complicated execution paths.
#
# A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.
